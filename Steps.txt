Step 1.	Run SAS codes to Import data and merge (In SAS software). Codes available in 
	SAS_CODES_FOR_DATA_IMPORT.

Step 2.	The output generated will be a dataset called Accident_Final.

Step 3.	The Accident_Final dataset is to be imported to R. The code is available in the folder R MODEL CODE.

Step 4.	C5.R is the C5.0 model run code.

Step 5.	Accident_Analysis.R is the main code which runs on NaiveBayes methodology. Bayesian methodology has 
	been selected post various checks on models.

Step 6. Various comments have been included in the code describing the work done.
